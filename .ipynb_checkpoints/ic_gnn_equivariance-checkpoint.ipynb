    "# Rotationally equivariant graph neural networks for integrated circuits\n",

    "\n",
    "Many systems are rotationally inviariant.  Exploiting this symmetry can improve model performace and robustness.  Using a neural network model which exploits this symmetry guarantees that the model behaves the same way regardless of the orientation of the input data.  It also typically improves performance of the model.  Here's an example of the benefits of equivarience when applied to CNNs:\n",
