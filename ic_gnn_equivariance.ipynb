    "# Rotationally equivariant graph neural networks for integrated circuits\n",
    "\n",
    "This file contains some rough notes on how you might apply rotational equivariance to\n",
    "a graph neural network describing an integrated circuit.  Such graphs might include information about the physical locations of the wires and circuit components.  The predictions you make from a GNN should not change if you rotate coordinates by 90 degrees or 180 degrees.  But if you use an ordinary GNN, this is not gauranteed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why bother?\n",
    "\n",
    "Many systems are rotationally inviariant.  Exploiting this symmetry can improve model performace and robustness.  Using a neural network model which exploits this symmetry gaurantees that the model behaves the same way regardless of the orientation of the physical position of nodes in the input graph.  It also improves performance of the model.  Here's an example of the benefits of equivarience when applied to CNNs:\n",
